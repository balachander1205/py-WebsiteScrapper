['colinwu@oakland.edu'],"7Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) codes for a DNA repair protein that facilitates the8repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in human cells through the homologous9recombination (HR) pathway. Mutations of  BRCA1  are highly associated with breast cancer;10however, many variants remain unclassified with unknown cellular phenotypes. The DNA binding11activity of BRCA1 is localized primarily to its central region, which can be divided into two12distinct domains: DNA Binding Domain 1 (DBD1; amino acids (aa) 330-554) and 2 (DBD2; aa13894-1057). We previously proposed a model in which DBD1 targets BRCA1 to DSBs for the14promotion of DNA end resection, while DBD2 targets BRCA1 to telomeres to function in15chromatin remodeling and telomere regulation. In this study, we hypothesized that unknown DBD16variants (T374I, K408E, N417S, N909I, M1008I, and R1028H) with similar properties to known17disease-causing variants (Q356H, F461L, R496H, D940Y, S1027N, and E1038G) would also be18pathogenic. The affinities of each variant for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded19DNA (dsDNA), and a G-quadruplex (G4) sequence were measured via biolayer interferometry.",Pathogenic BRCA1 DBD variants exhibit altered DNA binding affinities and susceptibility to menadione,"1  Department of Chemistry, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, 48309, USA",D:/Projects/Freelance/py-WebsiteScrapper/static/pdfs/2025-07-16/2025.07.10.664210v1.full.pdf
"['ssuarezc@unmsm.edu.pe', 'lsalcedov@unmsm.edu.pe']","Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic widely prescribed for a variety of psychiatricdisorders. Despite its widespread use, its subacute effects on oxidative metabolism in brain andliver tissues remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of risperidoneon antioxidant enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation in rats. A total of fifteen male Holtzmanalbino rats were randomly assigned to a Control group (n=5, no risperidone) and two treatmentgroups (n=5 per group) receiving 0.4 mg kg -1  day -1  and 4.0 mg kg -1  day -1  risperidone, administeredvia orogastric gavage for 20 consecutive days. After treatment, brain and liver tissues werecollected. The activity of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase(GPx), Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) wasanalyzed. Reduced Glutathione (GSH) levels and lipid peroxidation, measured as thiobarbituricacid reactive substances (TBARS), were quantified. Findings indicate that in brain tissue, bothdoses significantly increased CAT activity and decreased the SOD/CAT ratio, and that the highdose significantly reduced TBARS levels. In liver tissue, a significant increase in CAT activity wasobserved with the high dose. Furthermore, both doses significantly increased G6PDH activityand reduced TBARS levels. These results underscore the influence of risperidone on cerebral andhepatic oxidative metabolism during the subacute phase.",copper (II) sulfate as prepared in bidistilled water prepared in bidistilled water                         (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos).,,D:/Projects/Freelance/py-WebsiteScrapper/static/pdfs/2025-07-16/2025.07.14.664632v2.full.pdf
